## Design

### Colour Scheme

For color scheme, I took inspiration from the hero-image on the front page to generate a scheme that looked good.
<img src="assets/images/hero-index.jpg" width="400" height="280">
<img src="assets/images/readme/colorscheme.svg" width="400" height="280">

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the typography.

For headings, I used [Aboreto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aboreto?query=aboreto). I choose this font because of it's simple but yet fancy look since I didn't want it to stand out to much and make the look of the website unprofessional.

For bodytext, I used [Poppins Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) since I wanted the font weight to match the Aboreto font, and to make the website look clean and the text easy to read.
