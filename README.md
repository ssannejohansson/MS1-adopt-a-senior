## User Experience (UX)

## Design

### Colour Scheme

For color scheme, I took inspiration from the hero-image on the front page to generate a scheme that looked good. For this, I used [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/).<br>
<img src="assets/images/hero-index.jpg" width="300px">
<img src="assets/images/readme/colorscheme.svg" width="300px">

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the typography.

For headings, I used [Aboreto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aboreto?query=aboreto). I choose this font because of it's simple but yet fancy look since I didn't want it to stand out to much and make the look of the website unprofessional.

<img src="assets/images/readme/aboreto.png">

For bodytext, I used [Poppins Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) since I wanted the font weight to match the Aboreto font, and to make the website look clean and the text easy to read. 

<img src="assets/images/readme/poppinslight.png">

### Imagery

For all imagery, everything from logos to images, I've choosen clean and simple looks to keep the website from feeling cluttered. Please see the Technologies Used section for sources.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 

<details>
<summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/Homepage.png">
</details>

<details>
<summary>Adoption Page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/Adoption.png">
</details>

<details>
<summary>Contact Page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/Contact.png">
</details>

<details>
<summary>Success / Thank you page</summary>
<img src="assets/images/readme/Sucess.png">
</details>

### General features on each page
**Favicon** <br>
The favicon is converted from the [Logo](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/65580867-cat-silhouette-art-illustration-with-white-backgroun)  using [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). 

**Navbar** <br>
The navbar is created from a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) navbar that I later styled. For example, I moved the logo to the center instead of to the left to make it look consistent to the rest of the website. The navbar is fully responsive and I chose to position the links in the open nav to the left to follow the consistency of the logo and text. <br>
<img src="assets/images/readme/nav-desktop.png">
<img src="assets/images/readme/nav-mobiletablet.png">
<img src="assets/images/readme/opennav.png">


**Footer** <br>
The footer is created using a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) grid to make it fully responsive. At desktop, it's a two-column-layout and from tablet to mobile it comes down to one column. <br>
<img src="assets/images/readme/footer-desktop.png">
<img src="assets/images/readme/footer-mobiletablet.png">

### Future Implentations
- In the future, I will add a section at the adoption page dedicated for **success stories** due to meet the user stories. Even further, this could develop into a separate forum-page for people to write stories, share pictures and encouragements. 

- In a later update I'll also be adding a newsletter. This will function through a "Sign up for our newsletter" button that will trigger a modal where you can sign up for the newsletter. The newsletter will include new cats at the shelter, previous adoptions, success stories and guidance.

- Throughout the whole process of this site, I've had accessibility in mind. I've used semantic The Lighthouse report, see further down, is giving great scores but in the next update I will focus on making it even better.

## Testing

### Automated testing

#### W3C Validator
I used [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the HTML and CSS on all pages of the website. 

- **Home page** - No errors or warnings. 
- **Adoption page** - Error with the flip-card code.
<img src="assets/images/readme/error.png"> 
*Since I don't have a solution for this and everything is working in manual testing, I've decided to leave this error.*
- **Contact page** - No errors or warnings. 
- **Success page** - No errors or warnings.
- **Thank you page** - No errors or warnings. 
- **CSS** - No errors or warnings. 

#### Lighthouse
I used the Chrome Developer Tool Lighthouse to test performance, accessibility, best practises and SEO of the website. I run the test for both desktop and mobile. 

<details><summary>Home page</summary>
Desktop<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/homepage-desktop.png"><br>
Mobile<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/homepage-mobile.png">¨
</details>

<details><summary>Adoption page</summary>
 Desktop<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/adoption-desktop.png"><br>
Mobile<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/adoption-mobile.png">
    </details>

<details><summary>Contact page</summary> 
Desktop<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/contact-desktop.png"><br>
Mobile<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/contact-mobile.png">
    </details>

<details><summary>Success page</summary>
Desktop<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/success-desktop.png"><br>
Mobile<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/success-mobile.png">
    </details>

<details><summary>Thank you page</summary>
Desktop<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/thankyou-desktop.png"><br>
Mobile<br>
    <img src="assets/images/readme/thankyou-mobile.png">
    </details>
<br>

Overall, the accessibility, best practises and SEO results are great. 

The orange performance numbers are mostly due to image-sizes even though I compressed them with TinyPNG. In future projects, I will look into other ways of compressing images to get a better performance. 

The reason that the accessibility isn't perfect is mostly because of the color of the attributions in the footer. I choose to keep the color because i don't want the attributions to take focus from the other elements in the footer.

### Bugs

#### Solved Bugs

| Bug | How I solved it |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| On mobile, a line appeared between the shape-divider and heading for the "Are You Prepared?" section at home page. | Added a margin-bottom of 1px on the section to move the background-color of the section 1px up. This made the line move to the top, so I needed to add -1px margin-top too to fix that. |
| The About-link in the navbar does not work from other pages than home page.| Added index.html before #about to make it direct to index.html and then the section (index.html#about). |
| On mobile, the heart-shaped image at the success-page is too large and does not show properly. | Added the img-fluid bootstrap class to image to make it responsive. |
